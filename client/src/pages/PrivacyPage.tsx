					This policy is placeholder text and not binding.
				</p>
				<h2 id="privacy">Privacy Policy</h2>
				<p>
					Placeholder.com is operated by Quality Nonsense Ltd. Your privacy is
					extremely important to us. This policy sets out how Placeholder.com
					uses and protects any information collected when you use this website.
					It’s worth a read, but if you’re short of time, here’s the most
					important stuff:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						We won’t collect any personal information (eg. name, email address)
						without your explicit permission;
					</li>
					<li>We won’t send you promotional emails unless you’ve opted in</li>
					<li>
						We will never share, sell or rent sensitive information about you
						without your permission (unless required to by UK law)
					</li>
					<li>
						We have physical, electronic and managerial procedures to ensure
						your personal information is secure.
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					We hope it goes without saying that we will only use the information
					that we collect about you lawfully and in accordance with the UK Data
					Protection Act 1998. Above and beyond that, we will endeavour to use
					this information in a way that benefits you as a user.
				</p>
				<p>
					When we ask you to provide information by which you can be identified
					when using this website, you can be assured that it will only be used
					in accordance with this privacy statement.
				</p>
				<p>
					Our privacy policy may change from time to time. We’ll do our best to
					let you know but please do check back periodically for updates.
				</p>
				<h3>What Information We Collect</h3>
				<p>
					We will never collect sensitive information about you without your
					explicit consent. By ‘sensitive information’ we mean details like:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Your name</li>
					<li>Your email address</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					We also use cookies to collect non-sensitive information about your
					use of the site. This is standard on almost any website nowadays and
					allows us to understand how visitors use the site: which pages are
					most popular, which bits don&#8217;t work and so on.
				</p>
				<h3>How We Use This Data</h3>
				<p>
					We only send you promotional emails if you have explicitly opted-in.
					We do not sell, rent or share email addresses, and we never will. We
					will only share personal information when required by law (eg, if
					subpoenaed to do so).
				</p>
				<p>
					We will only pass your data on to third parties if you have explicitly
					agree that we do so.
				</p>
				<p>
					The reason we collect information like email addresses is to provide
					you with a better service. For example, we need some personal details
					to do the following:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>To improve our service</li>
					<li>
						Technical support (eg, if you are experiencing problems that we
						can&#8217;t replicate)
					</li>
					<li>
						User newsletters (you only receive this if you opt-in to receive it)
					</li>
					<li>
						To customise your user experience (eg, we can show your web hosts
						that match your requirements)
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					We use non-identifying and aggregate information to better design our
					website and to share with advertisers. For example, we may tell an
					advertiser that X number of individuals visited a certain area on our
					website. Or that Y number of men and Z number of women filled out our
					registration form, but we would not disclose anything that could be
					used to identify those individuals.
				</p>
				<h3>Security</h3>
				<p>
					We are committed to ensuring that your information is secure. In order
					to prevent unauthorised access or disclosure we have put in place
					suitable physical, electronic and managerial procedures to safeguard
					and secure the information we collect online.
				</p>
				<h3>Your IP Address</h3>
				<p>We may use your IP address for several reasons:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>To gather traffic &amp; user data using Google Analytics</li>
					<li>
						To customise your user experience (eg, we can show your web hosts
						that match your requirements)
					</li>
				</ul>
				<h3>Cookies</h3>
				<p>
					A cookie is a small file that asks permission to be placed on your
					computer&#8217;s hard drive. Once you agree, the file is added and the
					cookie helps analyse web traffic or lets you know when you visit a
					particular site.
				</p>
				<p>
					Cookies allow web applications to respond to you as an individual. The
					web application can tailor its operations to your needs, likes and
					dislikes by gathering and remembering information about your
					preferences.
				</p>
				<p>
					We use cookies with various analytics &amp; usability tools, such as:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Google Analytics</li>
					<li>Optimizely</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					Cookies help us provide you with a better website for many reasons,
					such as allowing us to see which pages are popular or unpopular. A
					cookie does not give us access to your computer or any information
					about you, except data that you choose to share with us.
				</p>
				<p>
					Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually
					modify your browser setting to decline cookies if you prefer. This may
					prevent you from taking full advantage of the website.
				</p>
				<h3>External Links</h3>
				<p>
					Our website contains links to other websites. We do not have any
					control over the content or behaviour of external websites, so cannot
					be responsible for the protection and privacy of any information which
					you provide whilst visiting such sites. External sites are not
					governed by this privacy statement.
				</p>
				<h3>Personal Information</h3>
				<p>
					If you have previously agreed to us using your personal information
					for marketing purposes, you may change your mind at any time by
					contacting us.
				</p>
				<p>
					You may request details of personal information which we hold about
					you under the Data Protection Act 1998. A small fee will be payable.
				</p>
				<p>
					If you believe that any information we are holding on you is incorrect
					or incomplete, please contact us immediately. We will promptly correct
					any information found to be incorrect.
